Assignment 01

for the coding problem, I did a nested loop to initiate from the first index of the array (int i =0) and traversed the whole array afterwards by (int j=i+1). then I multiplied the distance between two indexes of array with the minimum of the value of the two indexes, if they were greater than the value of max variable (I set the integar variable max=0) I put the value of max there and printed it.
